# OpenGl Planet Strategy Game

## Overview
This is not really notes about the game but notes about the process and steps i am taking to develop the project so i can reference this later.

## Adding the GLFW Library
I liked the method of adding GLFW as a git submodule and building the library paralell with the game. This way i can pull a new instance of the repo if i want to update GLFW
